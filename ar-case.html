                In 2018, I worked as a Senior Researcher on a team at ReD
                Associates conducting ethnographic research into the social
                impacts of face-worn augmented reality. I was involved in all
                stages of the project, including recruiting (manual and vendor
                relationship management), stakeholder interviewing, research
                protocol design and testing, field interviews, data analysis,
                report production, and presentaion to client stakeholders.
                <br /><br />
                Our work produced a social acceptability framework that was put
                into use by our client both as a tool for finding additional
                product feature opportunities, and as an ethical guide for
                future design ideation. <br /><br />

                While AR technology is nascent, SocialCo was well-positioned by
                previous investments in AR technology. What they didn't have was
                a depth of knowledge about the social and cultural impacts of
                possible AR interactions.

                Our research team conducted 3 large-scale public experiments, 15

                In addition to interviews with individuals, I conducted live
                intercept experiments wearing an AR glasses device or prototype
                and simulating behaviors in public spaces. We then made contact
                with and interviewed passersby and people in the surrounding
                area in order to understand their assumptions and reactions
                about the device wearer. <br /><br />

                We also conducted several controlled social experiments with a
                particular focus on participants from underrepresented minority
                groups. These used a variety of methods to isolate and simulate
                some of the key social experieces we hypothesized would result
                from mass adoption of AR glasses.
